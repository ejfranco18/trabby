This is a rails app generated with lewagon/rails-templates (https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), built by Le Wagon Madrid Graduates: Maja, Hervé, Javier, Niklas ♥️ (Batch#311)

Trabby is free to use (http://www.trabby.xyz/), and has one mission: to help people around the world to plan and experience the perfect trip. Our solution involves working through the preferences of the users, so that we can determine and quantify the objectives, and then make the best recommendations possible to the users.

We would want to say a special thank you to our amazing Le Wagon teachers who helped us build this product:
- Ricardo Otero; and
- Martin de Frutos.
